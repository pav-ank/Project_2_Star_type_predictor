# Star Type Predictor using Logistic Regression

## To acces the Web app:
click on this --> [Star_Type_Predictor](https://star-type.streamlit.app/)

- This web application allows you to predict the type of stars based on their physical parameters using Machine Learning. You can easily classify stars into different categories using two modes:

- Single Prediction Mode: Predict the type of a single star by inputting its features.
- Bulk Prediction Mode: Predict the types of multiple stars by uploading a CSV file containing star features.
